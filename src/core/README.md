### variants2matrix

variants2matrix is a St. Jude tool that is available from [St. Jude Research]
(`variants2matrix.tar.gz`). It is expected to be in `PATH`, along with its
Perl library and Java class paths, e.g.,

```
$ V2M_HOME=$CIS_X_HOME/vendor/variants2matrix
$ wget http://ftp.stjude.org/pub/software/cis-x/variants2matrix.tar.gz
$ tar xf variants2matrix.tar.gz --directory $CIS_X_HOME/vendor
$ export PATH=$V2M_HOME/bin:$PATH
$ export PERL5LIB=$V2M_HOME/lib/perl:$PERL5LIB
$ export CLASSPATH=$V2M_HOME/lib/java/bambino-1.0.jar:$V2M_HOME/lib/java/indelxref-1.0.jar:$V2M_HOME/lib/java/picard.jar:$V2M_HOME/lib/java/samplenamelib-1.0.jar:$CLASSPATH
```

### References

Reference files are not included with the source due to their large sizes.

Internal references are placed in `$CIS_X_HOME/refs`. These files can be
downloaded from [St. Jude Research] (`cis-x-refs-*.tar.gz`). It includes a
blacklist of problematic polymorphism markers and two reference expression
matrices for T-ALL and NBL.

External references are expected to be in `$CIS_X_HOME/refs/external`. These
are not distributed with cis-X, but the `cis-X seed` command can download and
generate them. See [cis-X seed] for more details and a list of required
reference files.

## Inputs

Running cis-X requires quite a few inputs.

  * `sample-id`: The sample ID. This is primarily used as the prefix for the
    filenames of the results.

  * `results-dir`: The output directory. See "[Outputs](#outputs)" for the
    resulting files.

  * `markers`: A list of single nucleotide markers. This is a tab-delimited
    file with the following columns:

      * `Chr`: chromosome name for the marker
      * `Pos`: genomic start location for the marker
      * `Chr_Allele`: reference allele
      * `Alternative_Allele`: alternative allele
      * `reference_tumor_count`: reference allele count in the tumor genome
      * `alternative_tumor_count`: alterative allele count in the tumor genome
      * `reference_normal_count`: reference allele count in the matched normal genome
      * `alternative_normal_count`: alternative count in the matched normal genome

    This file can be generated with Bambino.

  * `cnv-loh`: CNV/LOH regions. It contains all the genomic regions carrying
    copy number variations (CNV) or loss of heterozygosity (LOH), which will be
    filtered out during analysis.

    This is a tab-delimited file in the bed format. It must have at least the
    following three columns:

      * `chrom`: chromosome name
      * `loc.start`: genomic start location
      * `loc.end`: genomic end location

    If no CNV/LOH are in the genome under analysis, a file with no rows (but
    including headers) can be provided.

    This file can be generated with CONSERTING.

  * `bam`: The RNA-Seq BAM file aligned to hg19 (GRCh37). The index file is
    expected to be in the same directory with the same name and extension
    `.bai`, e.g, `/path/to/SJ001_D1.bam` and `/path/to/SJ001_D1.bam.bai`.

    StrongArm or STAR can be used for RNA-Seq alignment.

  * `fpkm-matrix`: A gene expression table. This is a tab-delimited file
    containing gene level expressions for the tumor under analysis. The
    expressions are in FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million
    mapped reads).

      * `GeneID`: gene [Ensembl] ID
      * `GeneName`: gene symbol
      * `Type`: [transcript type](https://www.gencodegenes.org/gencode_biotypes.html)
      * `Status`: transcript status (must be `KNOWN`, `NOVEL`, or `PUTATIVE`)
      * `Chr`: chromosome name
      * `Start` genomic start location
      * `End`: genomic end location
      * [SampleID...]: FPKM for the given sample

    This file can can be generated with the output of HTseq-count
    preprocessed through `src/other/mergeData_geneName.pl`. The data must be
    able to match values in the given gene specific reference expression
    matrices (see [cis-X ref-exp]) generated from a larger cohort.

  * `snv-indel`: Somatic SNV/indels. This is a tab-delimited file containing
    somatic sequence mutations present in the genome under analysis. It includes
    both single nucleotide variants (SNV) and small insertion/deletions (indel).
    The file must have the following columns:

      * `chr`: chromosome name
      * `pos`: genomic start location
      * `ref`: reference allele genotype
      * `mutant`: mutant allele genotype
      * `type`: mutation type (either `snv` or `indel`)

    Note that the coordinate used for an indel is after the inserted sequence.

    If no SNV/indels are in the sample under analysis, a file with no rows
    (but including headers) can be provided.

    This file can can be created with Bambino and then preprocessed using the
    steps taken in "[The genetic basis of early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia][22237106]".

  * `sv` Somatic SVs. This is a tab-delimited file containing somatic-acquired
    structural variants (SV) in the cancer genome. The file must have the
    following columns:

      * `chrA`: chromosome name of the left breakpoint
      * `posA`: genomic location of the left breakpoint
      * `ortA`: strand orientation of the left breakpoint
      * `chrB`: chromosome name of the right breakpoint
      * `posB`: genomic location of the right breakpoint
      * `ortB`: strand orientation of the right breakpoint

    Strand orientations are denoted with a `+` for a sense or coding strand
    and `-` for a antisense or non-coding strand.

    If no somatic SVs are in the sample under analysis, a file with no rows (but
    including headers) can be provided.

    This file can be generated by CREST.

  * `cna` Somatic CNV. This is a tab-delimited file containing the genomic
    regions with somatic-acquired copy number aberrations (CNA) in the cancer
    genome.

      * `chr`: chromosome name
      * `start`: genomic start location
      * `end`: genomic end location
      * `logR`: log2 ratio

    If no somatic CNVs are in the sample under analysis, a file with no rows
    (but including headers) can be provided.

    This file can be generating by CONSERTING.

  * `disease`: The disease name.

  * `cnv_loh_action`: The behavior when handling markers in CNV/LOH regions. Can
    be either `keep` or `drop`.

  * `min_coverage_wgs`: The minimum coverage in WGS to be included in the
    analysis.

  * `min_coverage_rna_seq`: The minimum coverage in RNA-seq to be included in
    the analysis.
